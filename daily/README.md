# Daily Commits 
An effort to make sure we keep our promises to each other :) 

## Directory Structure 
The goal is to each complete several sets of problems each week and 
be able to push them up here. We want to document these practices 
so they don't slide easily. 
- `p` belongs to Ivy 
- `g` belongs to YJ 

## Dashboard
Maybe we should track how long it takes for us to complete the problems 
going forwards, but for now this section is WIP.
